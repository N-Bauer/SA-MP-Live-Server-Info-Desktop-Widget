SA-MP-Live-Server-Info-Desktop-Widget
=====================================

Version 2.1R Relased

Greetings. I want to introduce the first application within the "Quick Smart +". The project is based on creating GUI applications for Windows and the Android platform by Quick Design Studio (Bauer). As part of the project will be presented and distributed applications for users from different fields.

Today I present you another relase version Widget for tracking the latest information from the SA:MP server.

New minimalistic design 590x90px: http://i.imgur.com/z8i7gjF.png


If the widget does not look like on the picture, please download and install the following font: http://bbmc.info/smart/font.zip

So the look is very simple. The application updates the information itself every 10 seconds or so if you want using the right-click on the background and selecting Refresh / Osvezi and server will receive current information. 
Widget moves by keeping the mouse on the background of the application.

Installation: 

All you need to do is open the file "config.ini" and edit the server information (IP, Port)
